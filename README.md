Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wanted to build a cross-platform, web-based version of their existing game, Draw It or Lose It. They needed a single game instance in memory at any time, unique and searchable game/team names, support for multiple players per team, and the ability for more than one team to play in a game.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I dove deep into unbiased research to find the best fit for their needs. By focusing strictly on the facts, I showed the client that every recommendation was chosen with their goals in mind—not personal preference.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having a solid Software Design Template (SDT) acted like a GPS for coding: it kept me on track, prevented wasted effort, and made sure I was building exactly what the client signed off on.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I’d tighten up the wording to be more concise. Leaner, punchier statements and make it clearer on what we’re doing and leave no room for misinterpretation.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I put myself in the players shoes prioritizing a smooth, intuitive experience and rock-solid security. It’s crucial because if users don’t enjoy or trust the product, they won’t stick around or come back for the next game.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My starting point was always “What does the client actually need?” From there, I documented every component clearly so anyone (including my future self) can pick up the code and immediately see how each piece works and how to adapt it for new projects.
